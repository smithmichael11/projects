# Projects #

I have created a series of documents and videos to showcase my key cybersecurity projects. Dive in and explore the details, highlights, valuable skills developed. I delve into various cybersecurity projects, extracting valuable lessons and insights from each endeavor.

## Key Projects:

### Home Network Penetration Testing Reporting & Legal Authorization Project | Dec. 2025 | Technology Law & Cybersecurity Engagement | Focus: Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), Cybersecurity Legal Frameworks

•	Drafted comprehensive pre-engagement legal authorization suite including Authorization to Test, Rules of Engagement, Statement of Work, and Confidentiality Agreement; analyzed CFAA (18 U.S.C. § 1030) risk exposure and structured explicit written consent to distinguish authorized testing from unlawful access.
•	Defined scope boundaries, prohibited activities, and escalation procedures to mitigate civil and criminal liability; integrated legal governance controls with NIST/PTES technical methodology.
•	Performed internal penetration test on home network, migrating devices from ISP modem to hardened GL.iNet router with segregated LAN and Guest SSIDs.
•	Performed comprehensive network security assessments, vulnerability analysis, and embedded device hardening using industry-standard tools and methodologies. Practical expertise in network architecture design, including migrating home networks from ISP modem configurations to hardened router deployments with segregated wireless networks.

### Home Network Penetration Testing & Router Hardening Lab | Dec. 2025 | GL.iNet OpenWRT Security Assessment | Tools: Nmap, tcpdump, Dropbear SSH, OpenWRT/Linux, netstat

•	Performed internal penetration test on home network, migrating devices from ISP modem to hardened GL.iNet router with segregated LAN and Guest SSIDs.
•	Conducted reconnaissance using Nmap to identify 9 active hosts and enumerate services: hardened SSH with key-based authentication and disabled password login
•	Deployed tcpdump f.or traffic monitoring and validated network segmentation through ARP/neighbor table analysis.
•	Identified service exposure on endpoints (printer interfaces, VNC, SMB) and provided prioritized remediation recommendations following NIST/PTES methodology.
